A simple Library Management System in JavaSwing and My SQL Database that I wrote for class group project. Yup it was a class project but I had to write it on my own entirely
Now don't start judging me on this :-P , I wrote it because I love programming and java in those early years of college where I didn't have much idea about real time systems and was still exploring and finding my ways into get my foundations strong in this vast IT feild
Uploading it here to show my love and passion for programming and computer science to my peers
